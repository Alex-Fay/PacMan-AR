# PacMan-AR
PacMan AR game - mobile phone edition allows users to play pacman in 3D 

The goal of this project is to explore AR and hopefully have fun while doing it. 

I created pacman and the ghosts using Blender (a new tool for me so hopefully the ghost improve with time).

## End Goal
Users will use a joid control to play 3D pacman anywhere. Ideally, after setting up all avatars and making a functioning game, I'd like to try and make it first person (from PacMan's point of view). Making it more suprising when you see a ghost. I plan to add sound to ghost as they approach in order to add suspsense. This is an entirely just for fun project, so we will see where it goes.

Thoughts of now...
add power ups to pacman to make walls clear for 15 seconds to see ghost
power ups for speed
if not first person, then make it multi layered, with elavators, and obstacles (moving levels)?

Current status:
created pacman, 7 ghosts, and first pacman scene
plans for the week: add background, walls, add Chase method, add Fear Mode (when pacman eats special pellets), first ghost tests
